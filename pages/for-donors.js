            Our volunteers looked for organizations endorsed in the media. We‚Äôve also considered the relevance and urgency of fundraising efforts.

            <strong>Volunteer-driven fundraisers:</strong><br></br>
            Our volunteers actively looked for potential red flags during the onboarding process and used their subjective discretion when approving submissions. <br></br><br></br>For smaller campaigns posted by people with credible social media presence on the behalf of volunteers, we&#39;ve asked them to:<br></br><br></br></p>

            By aggregating useful data, our goal was to make it as easy as possible for you to evaluate fundraisers. If you‚Äôre considering a large donation, but feel like there‚Äôs not enough information on the fundraiser you wish to support, please use the ‚ÄúRequest Information‚Äù feature and we will get you in touch with the organizers as soon as possible. We are also working on a comment section feature that would allow fundraisers to post updates and photo evidence.</p>

          <OneFaq title='Why donate to volunteer-driven fundraisers?'>
            <p>One of our main goals was to make evaluation of smaller volunteer-driven fundraisers simple. Volunteers do much of the work of coordinating emergency humanitarian aid to Ukrainians. These are political activists, Ukrainian diaspora, friends and family members of people requiring immediate aid. They are in direct contact with people on the ground and understand their immediate needs best. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            As a part of a large informal network of volunteers, they purchase and deliver the supplies like medicines, food, body armor, and first aid kits. All charitable donations are crucial, but please take the extra moment to consider these fundraisers.</p>
