                        <p>
                            Ukrainian volunteers are a major force behind local
                            aid collection, refugee support, evacuation efforts,
                            and supply coordination for civilian defense units.
                            They are in direct contact with people on the ground
                            and understand their immediate needs best.

                        <p>
                            When fundraising, they often cannot publicize
                            detailed evidence of financial transactions, how
                            many units of aid were purchased, or where it was
                            delivered. If made public, enemy intelligence could
                            use this information to organize ambushes,
                            endangering delivery volunteers and aid recipients.

                            While Help Ukraine Now displays information and
                            photo evidence already shared on media, we
                            understand the danger of asking for detailed
                            reports. To help volunteers secure funds from
                            broader audiences, we ask them to use a credible
                            social media platform to host the fundraisers.

                            If volunteers don‚Äôt have access to a credible social
                            platform, a reputation backer could help. They
                            should have a meaningful social media platform, be
                            willing to reveal their identity and conduct
                            additional due diligence of the volunteer efforts
                            they are vouching for.
